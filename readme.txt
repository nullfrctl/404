404 --- a simple tf2 config --- by /dev/null

  ยง  Introduction

404 is a very simple tf2 config operated by symlinks.

running sync.sh with your shell should automatically set up the symlinks.
if it doesn't, please open an issue and give an idea of how to fix it. i'm very 
new to scripting and help would be appreciated.

to update or add to the vpk files within the custom folder, just replace them or
add to them. sync.sh should automatically detect your changes.
