404 --- a simple tf2 config --- by /dev/null

ยง Introduction

404 is a very simple tf2 config operated by symlinks.

running sync.zsh with zsh will, assuming you have the regular path for tf2, aut-
omatically set up the symlinks.

to update or add to the vpk files within the custom folder, just replace them or
add to them. sync.zsh should automatically detect your changes.
